/*
 *
 * Cpp example: i2c_scanner_strict
 *
 * A stricter I2C scanner for Linux. It writes one dummy byte before STOP,
 *
 * ensuring a real data-phase ACK instead of accepting address-only ACKs.
 *
 * This prevents false positives from devices that ACK address probes but
 *
 * would NACK real writes (e.g., AVR/ATmega Wire slaves).
 *
 * Useful when scanning buses with AVR Wire devices or when verifying that
 *
 * a device acknowledges both the address and the data phase.
